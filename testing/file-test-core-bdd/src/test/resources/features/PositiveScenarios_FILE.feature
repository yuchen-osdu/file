Feature: File Service API integration test

  Background:
    Given I generate user token and set request headers with "PRIVATE_TENANT2"

  #Positive scenario for FILE service
  @File
  Scenario Outline: Verify that file is uploaded to landing zone and downloaded from persistent zone successfully and content is verified
    Given I hit File service GET uploadURL API
    Then service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode> and upload input file from <inputFilePath>
    When I hit File service metadata service POST API with <inputPayload> and data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then Service should respond back with <postReponseStatusCode>
    When I hit File service GET download signed API with a valid Id
    Then download service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode>
    When I hit signed url to download a file within expiration period at <outPathToCreateFile>
    And name <name> and content of the file uploaded <outputFilePath> and downloaded <inputFilePath> files is same

    Examples:
      | name                   | getReponseStatusCode | inputPayload                                                         | postReponseStatusCode | tenant            | inputFilePath                              | outputFilePath              | outPathToCreateFile                            |
      | "test.csv"             | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_CorrectPayload_json.json"                      | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/test.csv"            | "/sample_downloaded_files/" | "/src/test/resources/sample_downloaded_files/" |
      | "TestDownloadUrl.txt"  | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_CorrectPayload_txt.json"                       | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/TestDownloadUrl.txt" | "/sample_downloaded_files/" | "/src/test/resources/sample_downloaded_files/" |
      | "Test,DownloadUrl.txt" | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_CorrectPayload_txt_Non-Standard_FileName.json" | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/TestDownloadUrl.txt" | "/sample_downloaded_files/" | "/src/test/resources/sample_downloaded_files/" |

  #Positive scenario for FILE service

  Scenario Outline: Verify that metadata can be retrieved and is same as the time of posting
    Given I hit File service GET uploadURL API
    Then service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode> and upload input file from <inputFilePath>
    When I hit File service metadata service POST API with <inputPayload> and data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then Service should respond back with <postReponseStatusCode>
    When I hit File service GET metadata signed API with a valid Id
    Then metadata service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode>

    Examples:
      | getReponseStatusCode | inputPayload                                    | postReponseStatusCode | tenant            | inputFilePath                   |
      | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_CorrectPayload_json.json" | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/test.csv" |

  @File
  Scenario Outline: Verify that meta and tags block can be retrieved and is same as the time of posting in payload
    Given I hit File service GET uploadURL API
    Then service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode> and upload input file from <inputFilePath>
    When I hit File service metadata service POST API with <inputPayload> and data-partition-id as <tenant>
    Then Service should respond back with <postReponseStatusCode>
    When I hit File service GET metadata signed API with a valid Id
    Then metadata service should respond back with a valid <getReponseStatusCode> and <metablock>

    Examples:
      | getReponseStatusCode | inputPayload                                          | postReponseStatusCode | tenant            | inputFilePath                   | metablock                                         |
      | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_Single_object_MetaAndTags.json" | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/test.csv" | "/output_payloads/Single_object_MetaAndTags.json" |
      | "200"                | "/input_payloads/File_Multi_objects_MetaAndTags.json" | "201"                 | "PRIVATE_TENANT2" | "/sample_upload_files/test.csv" | "/output_payloads/Multi_objects_MetaAndTags.json" |
